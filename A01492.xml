            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT hath alwaies bene an auncient cuſtome euen from the very beginning of Chriſtian religion,<note place="margin">The nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> that whoſoeuer geueth his name to our Sauiour Chriſt, profeſſing him ſelfe a ſworne ſouldier of his ſpirituall Campe, therin to fight vnder his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious ſtandard; ſhould by no other oath be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this holy warfare: than by a ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either made by him ſelfe, or by his godfathers in his name, of renouncing the Deuell and all his workes with all his pompes and vanities. This ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath euer bene accounted in the wholl life of a Chriſtian, not only moſt forceable for the moſt ſtrict obligation; it being an homage &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto the greateſt Soueraignty which poſſible may be, that is to God himſelfe: but withall, a moſt effectuall remedy and a moſt ſure protection for the comfortable memory therof, againſt all tentations and incounters of our ghoſtly enemies.</p>
            <p>For who is he, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> being aſſaulted with proude and haughty cogitations, or tickled with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering repreſentations of vnlawfull delightes, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured with the tranſitory vanitie of worldly riches, or terrified with the barbarous manacings of bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perſecutours, or daunted with the manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties of the dayly and continuall combate with fleſh and blood, or finally enuironed on euery ſide with neuer ſo diuers troupes of the world the fleſh and the Deuell all conſpiring in one againſt the welfare of the ſoule: by the remembrance of this irreuocable profeſſion, and indiſpenſable promiſe vnto God, will not preſently be encouraged therby
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13387:4"/>vtterly ouercoming all manner of difficulties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to ſay either with that heathen Capitaine lacta eſt alea, my chaunce is caſt: or with the deuout and ſpirituall ſoule, Inceptum eſt, retro abire non licet: I haue begone, I may not returne backward: or with our Sauiour himſelfe: no man putting his hand to the plough,<note place="margin">Luc. 9.</note> and looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is fitte for the kingdome of God. For this cauſe did holy S. Chryſoſtome exhorte vs that we ſhould continually haue this word in our mouth,<note place="margin">Hom. 21. ad pop. Antioch.</note> I renounce thee o Satan, affirming that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſafe than this word, if in all our works we remember it.<note place="margin">lib. 1. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra. c. 2.</note> Yea this moreouer he addeth &amp; therunto doth S. Ambroſe conſent, that all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we muſt in the day of iudgement yeeld vnto almighty God, is but of the obſeruation of this one worde, and of the dilligent fulfilling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrict obligation conteined in the ſame. As there is none of you (ſaith S. Chryſoſtome) who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhoes and veſtments would chooſe to go into the market-place, ſo neuer go abroad without this word: but whan thou arte ſtepping ouer the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholde, firſt ſpeake this word, I renounce thee O Satan, &amp; I ioyne my ſelfe vnto thee O Chriſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer go forth without this voice. thou ſhalt finde this voice a ſtaffe, thou ſhalt finde it thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, thou ſhalt finde it an inuincible fortreſſe. with this word alſo make the Croſſe in thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,<note place="margin">The Croſſe in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> for ſo not only any man whom thou maieſt chaunce to meete, but the Deuell himſelfe can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hurt thee, whan he ſhall ſee thee euery where appearing with this armour. thus S Chryſoſtom.</p>
            <p>Neither doe we want moſte euident places of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13387:4"/>ſcripture, which doe plainly teſtifie vnto vs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this renunciation, it being the very ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of Chriſtian religion, &amp; the only end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the ſonne of God into the world: neither did hee come to bring peace into the earth, but a ſword: neither can that man follow him which daily taketh not vp his Croſſe: neither can any one be his Diſciple which renounceth not togither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſelfe, whatſoeuer other thing may be vnder God. What greater renunciation can there be of any thing, than the hatred of the ſame? What thing can be more deare vnto vs than our owne life or ſoule? &amp; yet is this a neceſſary rule for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer cometh vnto Chriſt, that he cary a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all &amp; rooted hatred euen to his owne life &amp; ſoule. than is our life hated when it is diſpiſed for Chriſt: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is our ſoule hated wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is afflicted, mortified, and clenſed from the filthy diſorder of ſeculer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes for the loue of the ſame Chriſt: who for one brittle and tranſitory life, either deſpiſed or loſt for his name, will repay an eternall and moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py immortality: and for an imperfect, vncleane, rebellious ſoule; humbled, mortified, and purged through the aſſiſtance of his grace according to the meaſure of this life: will tender the ſame ſoule in the other life without ſpotte or wrinckle, adorned with all the bewtifull giftes of his vnſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.<note place="margin">How little regarde there is now of renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the wholle occaſion of this preſent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. For I ſee (and that not with ſmall griefe) that for want of dew conſideration of this ſo neceſſary a precept of Chriſtian life, infinite multitudes of all maner of eſtates do daily periſh: I ſee that ſuch is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13387:5"/>the forgetfulnes of thoſe which ſhould be the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Chriſt, that as though this vertew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation were a ceremony only of Monkes, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes, Freers and other religiouſe perſons, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the ſame as no parte of their Chriſtian dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I ſee that in ſteed of that vertuous and fruitfull hatred of ones ſelfe (the neceſſary effect of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation) euery one almoſt is ouercome with a blinde flattering perniciouſe ſelfeloue; and in ſteed of building in him ſelfe a ſpirituall Hieruſalem by loue of God, buildeth a confuſed Babylon by loue of the world.

Yet this muſt they of neceſſity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that as the holy Church of Chriſt now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed ouer all the world, although in moſt diuers places, yet is but one: euen ſo if we compare that Church w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> now is with times forepaſt: although in moſt diuerſe times, yet hath it alwaies bene but one, and is now and ſhall be to the worlds end, that which alwaies it hath bene, that is the ſelfe ſame one. and in like maner although the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler members of this ſame Church do neceſſarily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the mortality of our nature: yet in reſpect of the ſame vniuerſall and Catholicke vnity, and of the ſame ſpirit which gouerneth the Church: it is alwaies the ſame. and ſo this very young clergy as they call it cannot be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in maner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and doctrine from any clergy neuer ſo ould which hath bene Catholicke, ſo long as this clergy which now is though different in perſons from the ould, yet obſerueth all maner of ſubiection &amp; vnity to the one onely roote which is the ſea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke. As without all arrogancy we may ſay thus much, that neuer ſince the firſt conuerſion of our Countrey ſuch vnity was greater. there being not one perſon of the ſame either ordered, or endowed with neceſſary iuriſdiction, but receiuing it not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any particuler Biſhop, or ordinary autority of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſans, but by the immediate delegation or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

So that of the ſoundnes of this very new Clergy theſe ſcrupulous Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marian Deuines need not for to doubt: and if there be any ould Clergy wilfully and obſtinately oppoſite vnto this w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> now it pleaſeth them to terme the young Clergy: that Clergy ſurely is not the Clergy of the Catholicke Church, becauſe it hath ſwarued from the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble direction of the ſpirit of the Catholike Church, ſpeaking and teaching in Peters chaire.

            <p>Finally of our wholle Clergy for the moſt parte, onely excepting thoſe who by this flattering do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that it is lawfull to go to the Church haue ſought to feed the couetous and fearfull humours

The firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therfore ſhall be, to ſhew that it is very merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and acceptable vnto God, to renounce pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and all things for perfection. For if this be once fully perſwaded, leſſe difficulty will it be to proue that it is lawfull in caſes of neceſſity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond.

            <p>The fourth chapter we will make, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly of renunciation of a mans patrimony, and care of prouiſion for children.</p>

If therfore you profeſſe your ſelfe a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Chriſt, forſake not the tents in the which you muſt euen build that tower of which in the Goſpell our Lord ſpeaketh: for whoſoeuer remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the ſame tower &amp; vnder the banner of the word of God doth fight: him no tentations may pearce on any ſide. from thence both dartes being caſt do flye with great force, and being foreſeene are with moſt firme repaire auoided.<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> Conſider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt although he be our King, yet by reaſon of that ſociety through which he vouchſafed to be our brother, he calleth his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diers kinges and forewarned vs that euery one by ſetting forth ten thouſand ſhould be fitte for to ſight with a King which hath twenty thouſand.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13387:14"/>but a little before he brought thoſe forceable ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes of the tower and the king, marke what he ſaied.

But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto theſe ſimilitudes ſhould tend, by the very concluſion he ſufficiently opened. for he ſaied. So therfore euery one of you which renounceth not all thinges which he hath, cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Therfore as well the coſt for the building of the tower, as the ability of ten thouſand againſt a King with twenty, is nothing elſe, but that euery one renounce all that he hath. And the begining of his ſpeach doth accord with the laſt concluſion. For in this that euery one renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all things which he hath, is that alſo conteined that he hate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother &amp; wife and children and brethren and ſiſters, yea and his owne ſoule. For all theſe things are his owne, which for the moſt parte doe entangle and hinder the obtaining not of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate temporall and tranſitory things, but of that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13387:14"/>common good which ſhall remaine for euer. For in what maner at this preſent a certaine woman is your mother: in that maner ſurely ſhe is not my mother. this therfore is temporall and tranſitory: Euen as you ſee already that to be paſſed away that ſhe conceiued you, that ſhee caried you in her wombe, that ſhe brought you fourth, that ſhe nouriſhed you. But in that ſhe is a ſiſter in Chriſt, this ſhe is vnto you and to me &amp; to all thoſe vnto whom one heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly inheritance; God, as a Father; Chriſt, as a brother, in one ſociety of charity is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.

This may you very eaſely acknowledge in your owne mother. For whence proceedeth it that ſhe doth now incomber and intrappe you, and wreſt and pull you backe from your courſe begonne; but of that, that ſhe is your priuate and proper mother? for in that ſhe is the ſiſter of all thoſe whoſe father is God, and whoſe mother is the Church, ſhe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth no more you than me, and than all our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which loue her, not ſo as you in your owne houſe with priuate loue, but with publicke charity in the houſe of God This veyr thing therfor that you are lincked vnto her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> carnall alliance, ought for to worke this benefitte, that you may with more familiarity talke vnto her,<note place="margin">Affection to a mother</note> and with greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity counſaile her, that this her priuate loue vnto you may be deſtroied in her, leaſt ſhe make greater account that ſhe hath brought you fourth,

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13387:43"/>neceſſarily although in few wordes intreate herof.</p>
                  <p>There are therfore in generall two kinds of diuorces of man and wife.<note place="margin">Two kinds of diuorces in generall.</note> the firſt is nothing elſe but a declaration of the inualidity of a mariage vnlawfully contracted. whan becauſe of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, the contracte could not be ſufficient, and therfore is diſſolued by the Church: and of this we haue nothing at this preſent to ſay. The other is, whan that mariage which according to the law of God and nature was a true and perfect mariage, is notwithſtanding ſeparated by lawfull meanes and of this muſt we make our wholle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>This ſeparation therfore is of three ſortes.<note place="margin">Three kinds of ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a lawfull mariage.</note> For either the mariage is quite diſſolued the parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining free from the former bond: or the bond of the mariage being ſtill in force, there is a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made ſometimes of bedd onely, ſometimes euen of all cohabitation.<note place="margin">§. 2.

                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.28. q. 2. Can. ſi infidelis. &amp;c. Qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to &amp; cap Gau demus de diuortijs.</note> the one party comming to our holy faith, may marry againe and ſo the firſt mariage may be diſſolued in three caſes. firſt if the party which remaineth infidell will not dwell with the faithfull ſecondly if he will not (ſine contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia aut iniuria Creatoris) without contumely or iniury of Chriſt. Thirdly if by reaſon of ſome ſcandall which may happen the faithfull be bound
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13387:43"/>to forſake his firſt mariage. as now in diuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is practiſed and by law eſtabliſhed, that ſuch a faithfull perſon ſhall be ſeparated from the other remaining an infidell. For S. Paule doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely commaund, but geueth as it were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, not to diſmiſſe the infidell if he be content to dwell ſtill with the other.</p>
                  <p>Of this diſſolution of mariage we need not to intreate the caſe being cleare, and not in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey occurrent. yet this muſt be taught to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes, that they beware herin of the doctrine of thoſe heritickes, who agreeably to the reſt of their licentiouſe opinions maintaine that an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke may forſake his Catholicke wife and marry another. The holy Church teacheth that this rule of S Paule hath no place in the mariages of thoſe which haue bene baptized. although they were become heretickes yea and infidells or Turkes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of the mariage: or although after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either both or one ſhould fall into hereſy or infidelity. For the mariage of two baptized not lawfully hindered by any canonicall impediment, is alwaies a Sacrament and if it be once conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by no meanes can be diſſolued.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the bond it ſelfe of mariage is taken away, whan after the ſolemnization of the ſame, before it be conſummated by carnall copulation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the one party entereth into religion. for ſo ſoone as that party after ordinary probation maketh his ſolemne profeſſion, the other remaineth free, and may lawfully marry another,<note place="margin">Cap Ex publico. de conuerſ. coning.</note> yet for to take away all occaſion of fraude, the cannon lawe alloweth two monethes of liberty vnto one which determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

For although euery mariage contracted betweene baptized couples be a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t yet we ſee that it hath not that indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubillity and firmenes, which it hath after it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated: wheras without any diſpenſation it is diſſolued by profeſſion of religion. And that with great reaſon. For there be three ſignifications in mariage: firſt of the inuiſible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of Chriſt and the ſoule which is in grace. the ſecond of the coniunction of Chriſt with his wholle Church by the ſame grace and charity. the third of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of Chriſt with his Church by the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his humane nature, which he tooke vpon him in his incarnation. Now of this third doth proceed the perfect firmenes of mariage: although the other two are ſufficient to make it a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Hence was it that our Sauiour ſaied not:<note place="margin">Mat. 19. Alex. 3 cap. Ex publico. De conu. coning.</note> That which God hath ioyned lett not man ſeparate, but after that he had ſaied: now they are not two but one freſh. What meruaile therfore if that mariage may by ſome Eccleſiaſticall meanes be deuided,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13387:45"/>which is not yet conſummated, and where they be properly as yet two, and not two in one fleſh?</p>
                  <p>Beſides.<note place="margin">Hugo de S. vict lib. 2. de Sacr. par. 11</note> in mariage there are two coniunctions: the one ſpirituall by mutuall conſent of mindes: the other carnall by coniunction of bodies. But it ſeemeth very great reaſon that one ſpirituall bond, ſhould yeeld to another more perfect which is that of religion, wherby the ſoule is ioyned after ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler a maner vnto God. eſpecially, here being no iniury vnto the education of children becauſe there are none: nor vnto the other party now remaining free, and no way blemiſhed or made vnfitte for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mariage by the loſſe of virginity.</p>
                  <p>And wheras by the doctrine of the Apoſtle the carnall bond of mariage is diſſolued by the naturall death of the one party,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> in ſo much that if the ſame party ſhould be miraculouſly reuiued againe, yet might the wife chooſe whether ſhe would haue him, and if ſhe had maried another ſhe could not haue him: why ſhall not the ſpirituall death of one w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> by religiouſe profeſſion dieth to the world, be of ſufficient force to take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall bond of a mariage not conſummated?</p>
                  <p>Now if there be this difference in the firmity of theſe two mariages: why ſhall we not attribute the ſame autority to Gods Vicar in earth, for to diſſolue that by his ſoueraigne power of binding and loaſing,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> which a man may without his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation by his proper acte diſſolue? eſpecially wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there may be ſo vrgent cauſes of ſuch diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo important for the good of ſoules. All this we may confirme with an other truth in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For according to the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon &amp; ſound
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13387:45"/>opinion of Deuines the Pope may diſpenſe in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vowes of religion,<note place="margin">Nauar c. 12. num. 75. D. Tho. 4. d. 38. q 1. ar. 4.</note> and geue a Monke vpon iuſt cauſes leaue to returne to the world againe and to marry. and this hath bene diuerſe times donne. and there is no reaſon why he may diſpenſe in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not in ſolemne Vowes.<note place="margin">Richardus Durand. Palud. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior. Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus S. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin. Angel. Innocentius Hoſtien. Panorm.

Than why may not the Pope doe at once, that which by ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he may do ſeuerally?</p>
                  <p>Lett vs than conclude that in mariage which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummated none but God himſelfe can diſpence. who hath not diſpenſed, but onely in the mariage of infidells, whan one commeth to our holy faith. But in mariage onely contracted and not conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, the bond may be taken away in two ſortes. firſt by entrance into religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the one party, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpenſation or conſent of the other party: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by the diſpenſation of the Pope at the ſuite of both parties, or of the one onely whom the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath already vniuſtly forſaken. And although this laſt be not expreſely defined by the Church: yet is it very ſecure in practiſe: and it becommeth euery deuoute Catholicke with godly affection to perſwade him ſelfe, that ſo many cheife Paſtours of Gods Church. in ſo waighty a matter haue not erred.<note place="margin">§. 3</note>

Thoſe therfore which are the true children of God, muſt before they marry,<note place="margin">The ends of mariage.</note> laye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes the lawfull and godly endes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. that is, the deſire of children for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Gods houſe: the mutuall fidelity one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and continuall ſeruices &amp; comforte of this miſerable life: &amp; the auoiding of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they be ſuch as liſt not to fight againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſaultes of the fleſh: finally and principally the dignity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and perfect reſemblance of the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt and his Church.

For than (if it be manifeſtly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the innocent party) it is lawfull to whold the debt of matrimony. This is the doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour him ſelfe: For if it be lawfull to diſmiſſe the fornicator, much more to deny him the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall debt. yet be there ſome exceptions wherin it is not lawfull to make ſuch ſeparation. Firſt if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one party ſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other is dead marry another. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the act were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by violence. Likewiſe if the wife admitted another man, thinking that it was her owne husband. Beſides whan both parties haue committed fornication alſo whan one party conſented or gaue an imediate occaſion to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultry of the other Finally whan a reconciliation is made either by an expeſſe remiſſion of the fault: or by the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t parties demaunding or yeelding the debt of mariage after the ſaulte is once knowen. For than is he deemed to remitt the ſame. Excepte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife for ſome notable feare of the husband ſhold render the debt: for tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe hath not loſt her right to deny the ſame, neither was that a reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was not voluntarily made. In like maner after a voluntary reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made although both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were faulty, yea and although the one parties adultery were altogither vnknowen to the other: by ſuch reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are both reſtored to their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13387:49"/>prime eſtate. ſo that notwithſtanding any faulte paſt, that party which ſhall fall againe, may be iuſtly denied the matrimoniall debte by the other party perſeuering innocent.</p>
                  <p>Neither will it be amiſſe here to admoniſh, that the husband vſing the acte of mariage after any copulation had by his wife with an other man whether ſinfully or not ſinfully: whether him ſelfe ſtill remaining bound to her company or no: yet he is accounted Bigamus by the Church: and not admitted without diſpenſation vnto holy orders after the deceaſe of his wife, euen as if he had bene twiſe maried, or had maried a widow. which I the more willingly here do vtter, that whoſoeuer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous ſo to liue in the eſtate of mariage that he may not preiudice the vndertaking of a higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate if it pleaſe God to ſett him free: may beware herby to returne to the company of his wife, after ſuch accidents except in caſes where he may not without ſinne refuſe the ſame. For than better is it to putte him ſelfe in impoſſibillity of a higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to come, than in his preſent eſtate to offend God. Finally whanſoeuer one may lawfully make ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bedd, the ſame party may make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall vowe of chaſtity without the others co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, for he is not bound to any reconciliation. But if he chaunce to fall than is he bound to reconciliation and the other partye may irritate the vowe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made without his conſent. But if one not diſpoſed to vowe geueth the other leaue to vowe continency: it can neuer be reuoked againe: but onely vpon ſufficient cauſe bee diſpenſed by the Church.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13387:49"/>Now in the ſeparation not onely in bedd,<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> but alſo in the very cohabitation it ſelfe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt there offereth it ſelfe that excellent reſolution by mutuall conſent to vowe continency,<note place="margin">Of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of dwelling.</note> and both togither to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to religion the one of men, the other of women. For many maried cooples there are, which for that they haue worldly charges, or becauſe they cannot ſo eaſely frame them ſelues to the ſtrictnes of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe life, or becauſe of their age and vnfitnes for a religiouſe eſtate; do perfome that in the world, which vndoubtedly myght be more perfect in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

Neuertheleſſe that this is a very great ſtepp vnto that abſolute eſtate of perfection, we may not doubt, wheras many ſuch perſons haue entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to religion.

Thirdly for adultery in like maner: but of theſe two caſes we will ſay herafter more.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therfore that the one party may ſeparate him ſelfe not onely in bedd but alſo in habitation from the other for fornication. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> according to the doctrine of our Sauiour:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> although there is no ſuch bond of neceſſity, but onely whan there were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall: as may very well happen if the party delinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be the wife, &amp; the man knowing her fault ſhould ſeeme to allowe it: for than by reaſon of ſcandall he werer bound to diuorce her. the like daunger is not in wiues, towards their husbands whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is knowen more to abhorre from their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands diſorder herin. and by diuorcing their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands they could not amend them: and eſpecially becauſe they are not their husbands ſuperiours, as the husband is the wiues. In this caſe as we haue ſaied the party innocent may forſake the other, and enter alſo into religion or take holy orders without conſent: ſo that the condicions be obſerued which we ſpake of before in the like caſe of ſeparation in bedd. Yet is there here required the Churches autority, becauſe it is a publicke matter and ſubiect vnto ſcandall if it be not orderly donne.

For this muſt be well caried in mind that (as we ſaied aboue) no mariage of baptized perſons once co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummate can be ſo diſſolued that either of the parties may marry another. although the heretickes in this behalfe do play their partes: whom we cannot at this preſent attend to confute.</p>

Euery faithfull knoweth what hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, or wherin his mind is troubled &amp; often tempted. it is better to leade a ſolitary life, than for the neceſſities of this life to looſe the euerlaſting. Thus S. Hierome. Wherfore I do conclude that in caſe a woman by her husband bevrged to go to the Church or to do any vnlawfull acte of religion: much more than in other carnall ſinnes ſhe may, yea and is bound to forſake him, leaſt louing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

But if there be notorious adultery ioined withall, and iniurious want of all neceſſary ſpirituall helpes of Catholicke religion: I would not doubte but in our countrey where there is no lawfull Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Courte euen without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of peruerſion ſhe may forſake him.

                  <p>It happened that ſeauen brethren togither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their mother were taken, and compelled by the King to eate againſt the law ſwines fleſh, being tormented with whippes and ſcourges. One of them who was the firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſaide in this manner. What ſeekeſt thou,<note place="margin">Marke in all this hiſtory the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty of Martyrs in rebuking Tyrants.</note> and what wilt thou learne of vs? we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rather to dye, than to tranſgreſſe our countrey lawes of God. The King therfore being angry, commaunded frying pannes and braſen pottes to be made red hote, which being donne, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him which firſt had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue his tongue cutte out, and the ſkinne of his head being drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, that his handes and feete ſhould be cutte of, his other brethren &amp; his mother looking on And whan he was made altogither vnprofitable, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded fire to be brought, and him yet brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be roaſted in the frying panne: in which whilſt he was for a long time tormented, the reſt togither with their mother exhorted one another to dye ſtoutely; ſaying. our Lord God will looke vpon the truth,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> and will comforte vs. as Moiſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the proteſtation of his Canticle: And he will comforte his ſeruantes. The firſt than being

But he anſwering in his countrey language, ſaied: I will not do it. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alſo in the next place receiued the torments of the firſt And being in his laſt gaſping, he ſaid. Thou trewly (ô moſt wicked one) in this preſent life doeſt deſtroy vs, but the King of the world will raiſe vs againe which dye for his lawes, in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of euerlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>After him the third is deluded: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> &amp; being required he quickly brought out his tongue, and ſtretched forth his handes conſtantly: and confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſaied: From heauen I poſſeſſe theſe things, but for the lawes of God now I deſpiſe theſe very ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him I hope to receaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe. So that the King and thoſe which were with him did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the young mans mind, that he accounted his torments as nothing. This being thus dead, they vexed the fourth torturing him in the fame forte. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And whan he was euen at the pointe of death, he ſaied thus. it is better for thoſe which are putte to death by men, to expect hope from God, as being to be raiſed againe by him: for vnto thee there ſhall be no reſurrection vnto life. And whan they had brought the fifth, they vexed him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> but he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him, ſaied. Thou hauing power ouer men, wheras thou arte mortall, doſt what thou wilt but do not thinke that our generation is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God. but thou abide patiently, and thou ſhalt ſee his great power, and how he will torment

Going to the Church is a proteſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy.</note> the principall defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and iniquity, is that it ſignifieth a conformity in ſchiſme and falſe religion: ſo that it is nothing elſe of it ſelfe but a Proteſtation in facte of falſe religion. now by a contrary Proteſtation in words to ſeeke to diſanull the Proteſtation of the facte, what is it elſe, but as if a man very expert in the arte of lying, ſhould in telling two contrary tales w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one breath, deſire to be fully beleeued in both? But howſoeuer theſe abſurde Proteſters perſwade them ſelues,<note place="margin">Two lyes made by Proteſters.</note> yet haue they iuſtly receaued the ordinary reward of liers not to be beleeued at all. For wher as by the facte they ſhew them ſelues Proteſtants, no man yet beleeueth them: and wheras by their wordes they ſeeke to alter the nature of the facte, neither yet can they obtaine creditt, the facte of it ſelfe remaining as it was before. So that they come euery day from the Church loaden with two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and contrary lyes. (a ſmall faulte perhaps if they were not in ſo weighty a matter) the one that they are Proteſtants. the other that their fact doth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13387:76"/>ſignifie no ſuch thing, as is the profeſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy. I remember that I haue heard a pretty conceite of one who ſeeing vpon a ſuddaine that by our Parliaments religion was altered,<note place="margin">The Perſon of Croydon</note> and that defined and decreed ſuperſtition, which all our forefathers before accounted trew worſhipping of God: made earneſt petition to ſome Parliament Lord that it might be enacted by the autority afore ſaid that it ſhould be but fiue miles from his houſe to London, that ſo he might be deliuered from a longer trauaile whan he were to go thither. But whatſoeuer we may worthely attribute to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where there is higher autority, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent, more publicke proceedings &amp; meanes to diuulge abrode the knowledge of any matter. than in any other temporall thing can be poſſibly deuiſed: it is ſurely ouermuch prerogatiue to geue vnto the ſpeeches of euery perticuler ſchiſmaticke,<note place="margin">A Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be publicke enough to take away ſcandall.</note> that he may by one Proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make that another Proteſtation ſhall be no Proteſtation: although he would Proteſt euery time not onely in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitt but alſo in Printed Papers which ſurely were neceſſary if he would make his ſpeecehes of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation as well knowen as his Proteſtation of facte, and yet it were not ſufficient perhaps, wheras ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would heare of his fact which would not heare of his papers.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore being of it ſelfe thus ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurde, &amp; for ſuch cauſe as is worthely to be thoght very farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that learned Licentiates approbation: it ſeemeth yet more daungerous for the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any warrant of auncient practiſe or example. For it is a very ſtrange caſe, that in ſo many ages paſt, in ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13387:77"/>diuerſe &amp; long perſecutions ſtirred vp againſt Gods Church by infidells, heretickes, ſchiſmatickes: yet no memory ſhould be extant of any ſatisfying the perſecutours pleaſure by doing that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded with a Proteſtation: but that this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation ſhould firſt of all be heard of in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with Proteſtants: belike to ſhew that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters and Proteſtants are as neare in inward qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and conditions, as they are in the outward and materiall ſound of their names. And ſurely if the Pope ſhould condemne this opinion of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation as an hereſy: (as it may be he hath in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the defender &amp; maintainer therof:) than could we haue no fitter name for theſe new here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, than to call them Proteſting Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Of contrary Proteſtations we read oftentimes and almoſt euery where, that is: that the Saintes of God haue not onely not ſatisfied their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours deſires, but haue bouldly proteſted that they would not obey their vnlawfull commaundments. Be it knowen vnto thee ô King,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> that we will not worſhip thy Gods, &amp; the idoll which thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected we will not adore.

I obey not the precept of the King, but the precept of the law. Theſe are Proteſtations fitt for Chriſtians, honourable in the making, famous in the remembring, and moſt gloriouſe in their euerlaſting rewardes not thoſe which do as it were call God and heauen &amp; êarth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13387:77"/>to witneſſe, that the obedience of man is preferred before the obedience of God.</p>
               <p>Of like examples of Chriſtian Proteſtations all Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories are full: neither could euer the fury of perſecutours or extremity of torments driue the champions of Chriſt, to yeeld or ſeeme to yeeld to as indifferent thinges as going to the Church may ſeeme to be, and to ſeeke to iuſtifie ſuch actions by Proteſtation.</p>
               <p>This hath alwaies made me thinke that that good vertuous learned Deuine did neuer meane to allow a Proteſtation as theſe new Proteſters would haue him: conſidering the repugnance which it hath to his wholle argument of his treatiſe, and the abſurdity of the thing it ſelfe, which (although he ſpeake ſomewhat obſcurely) I cannot thinke but that his wiſdome could very well perceaue</p>
               <p>Yet do I not doubte but that he worthely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth a Proteſtation in ſome caſes.<note place="margin">A Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſome times profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> For this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of going to the Church is than vnlawfull, whan it is a Proteſtation of conformity in religion: which it is alwaies, whan there is ſuch orderly going as is vſed by the heretickes them ſelues, now it may be that in diuerſe caſes this orderlines and conformity may be wanting, &amp; than the going to the Church with heretickes is called but a materiall going and not a formall: becauſe the formality is by the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the eſſentiall conditions of ſuch going ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. in this caſe therfore whan going to the Church is no Proteſtation of falſe religion: it is not vnlawfull of it ſelfe: ſo that for to avoide ſcandall if there be any danger therof, I make a Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherin I ſhew my going to be onely materiall

Reg. 13.</note> was a formall going to idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they went orderly all alike. but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither of the Prophett to reprehend the King, was onely a materiall going to idolatry, and very well knowen to be of a diuerſe nature from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Naaman Syrus was materially preſent at ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry but not formally: becauſe he went not to the temple as vnto a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, but as vnto any other place where his perticuler temporall ſeruice might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted. neither did he obey his King commanding an acte of religion, but requiring onely the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſiſtance which to his greatnes was conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Now if Naaman had ſeene any probabillity of ſcandall, than ſhould he haue bene bound to haue made a Proteſtation. generally therfore wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no contrary Proteſtation in the facte, that is whan going to the Church with heretickes is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly materiall and not formall. than may a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be very well vſed in wordes: which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is not neceſſary, but in daunger of ſcandall. So that a Proteſtation doth not make that lawfull which was vnlawfull but ſheweth the lawfulnes of that which was iudged vnlawfull. neither maketh it that a materiall going which was formall: but onely declareth that to be materiall which was in deed materiall before.</p>
               <p>Many examples might be brought in our owne caſe,<note place="margin">Mr. Martins caſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation is examined.</note> of materiall going: but it hath bene ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently donne in other bookes. I will onely touch that caſe which Mr. Martin him ſelfe bringeth.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13387:78"/>A man may lawfully go ſaieth he to the Church with heretickes if he proteſt that he goeth to pray Catholickly. Trew it is if he not only proteſteth to pray Catholickly, but praieth in deed Catholickly and is there Catholickly preſent. Which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not than do, if he be indiſtinctly amongſt them, whatſoeuer praiers he ſay. for his facte is a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation that he is there to pray in hereticall vnion &amp; participation. and that moſt of all if he proteſt that he cometh for obedience: for the end of ſuch obedience, is participation with hereticks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet this will I ſay for Mr Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, that in caſe that he pray Catholickly, that is, that he ſhew a manifeſt diſunion with heretickes: he ſinneth not. But this cannot be as the caſe is with vs. yet can I put ſuch a caſe</p>
               <p>As if Catholicks &amp; herericks in league againſt the Turke had but one Church, and being agreed not to moleſt one the other, ſhould at one time in ſeuerall altars haue Maſſe and communion and yet the people of force were confuſed and mingled in the Church: in ſuch a caſe the Catholicke ſinneth not: and his Proteſtation may be vertuouſly vſed, although it be not neceſſary: for there being two ſeuerall ſeruices, the preſence onely is no more a profeſſion of the one than of the other. Thus I thinke Mr. Martins doctrine trew and I perſwade my ſelfe that he in very deed meant no more.<note place="margin">Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Mr. Martin held he would now alter his opinion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But letting this paſſe as a matter ſomewhat vncertaine what he held, whan this ſhifte was firſt propounded, and neuer examined before: there is no doubt at all, but if he had afterward knowen the contrary reſolution euen only of his Superiour,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13387:79"/>yea and of many other excellent particuler perſons beſides, amongſt ſo many hundreths which hould now the contrary: ſuch was his humility and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tew, that he would preſently haue yeelded to any one of them. For in matters of conſcience (a moſt ſuttell &amp; vnſearchable profundity) all particulers are not eaſely ſeene at the firſt: and deſire of not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding raſhly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe who may be endamaged with a ſeuere reſolution, cauſeth many times the determiner to take the more fauourable way, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very mother of truth doth after ſhew to be vnallowable wherof we may find in our countrey ſufficient examples in more waighty and apparent diſſimulations, than is this of going to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, as in the oath of the Supremacy, and receiuing the Proteſtants communion: which things how eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were ſwallowed vp either in K Henryes time or ſithence euery man knoweth: and how ſome Clergy men firſt allowed them, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſproued them, it is to to manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And it is worthy of conſideration, how theſe Proteſters do deale dubblely.<note place="margin">The dubble dealing of Proteſters.</note> For whan Mr Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin alloweth as they interprete him a Proteſtation: that is the Cenſure of the moſt learned man Mr. Gregory Martin. and we trewly thinke him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of much more praiſe, and that he needeth not the commendation of men, whom God hath; as we hope commended.

               <p>O deceitfull EVE alwaies excuſing: ô mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſerpent alwaies ſuggeſting excuſes in moſt waighty matters. Hath he not exacted ſufficient ſecurity before, when he requireth Confeſſion, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, reſonable hope of perſeuerance, which is all one with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe of amendment? And that he requireth leſſe ſecurity in this ſinne than in another, it is not for that it is no ſinne at all: but becauſe the daunger of other ſinnes ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon one circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or vpon a very few: but the daunger of this vpon infinite. One is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to laſciuiouſnes. take away the occcaſion W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is but one, that is familiar conuerſation with euell diſpoſed perſons, and he is out of daunger. One is geuen to fighting and brawling: cauſe him to liue more priuately in an orderly and ciuill houſe, and you ſee there is great ſecurity in his ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in Gods fauour.</p>
               <p>But one is very fearfull of his eſtate, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and ready to fall with euery blaſt of ſearches or Aſſiſes. in this man you can haue no ſecurity but his owne reſolution. For if he conuaigh ouer his landes, he may be putt in priſon. if he eſcape the Aſſiſes; he may be viſited by Purſeua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. if theſe be his frendes; yet ſome Iuſtice, or ſome Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner may haue him by the backe: as now a daies none are ſo buſy in ſuch baſe ſeruices as gentlemen them ſelues, and thoſe the neareſt neighbours: ſo that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not helpe this man, but he muſt alwaies be in preſent daunger of falling. onely his purpoſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13387:82"/>is neceſſary neuer to fall againe. which if he haue, although his ghoſtly Father thinketh that he will fall if occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be offered, yet is he bound to abſolue him. For this is a generall rule in all ſinnes,<note place="margin">Nauar. c. 3. nu. 13</note> that certainty or ſecurity of amendment can neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the ghoſtly Father of the Penitent: for neither the office of a ſouldier, nor of a merchant nor of diuerſe other like, can in all probabillity long time continew without ſinne: neither is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour onely not bound to beleeue certainely that ſuch will not ſinne againe: but the Penitents them ſelues are not bound to thinke ſo of them ſelues, as Nauar doth largely teach. Yett is there alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to firme purpoſe of the Penitent, which may very well ſtand with an vncertainty of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whan occaſion ſhall be offered: experience teaching vs that men of neuer ſo good reſolution may fall againe. Thus do we ſee in what manner leſſe certainty may be exacted in auoiding this ſinn than in others &amp; yet a firme purpoſe be neceſſary in this as well as in all others. Thus much be ſaid againſt thoſe which out of this letter defend it to be no ſinne.</p>
               <p>But there ariſeth a more ſubtill kind of perſons,<note place="margin">Againſt thoſe which ſay it is a venial ſinne</note> who hearing out of the ſame letter, that this going to the Church is by no meanes lawfull or diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, do confeſſe in deed that the letter condemneth it as a ſinne. but yet not as a mortall ſinne, or by which Gods grace is loſt, and the horrible guilt of eternall damnation incurred: but onely as a veniall ſinne, from which no iuſt mans life can be free, &amp; which alſo is by no maner of way diſpenſable, as well as a mortall ſinne.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13387:83"/>I muſt needes in theſe perſons not onely commend their ſubtelty of witte, in that they very well haue conceiued that a veniall ſinne cannot be diſpenſed withall: but admire alſo the tendernes of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: as being ſo ſcrupulous and fearfull, that they thinke it a worthy queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be toſſed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt Deuines, propounded to the Pope, reſolued from Rome to England, whether any action practiſed in our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey be a veniall ſinne or no. It were doubt les a moſt happy eſtate of our Countrey if either Catholicks made ſuch account of all veniall ſinnes, as this letter wiſheth they ſhould make of this, or thoſe W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are our Supiours had not need to let paſſe many thouſand veniall ſinnes W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troulment.</p>
               <p>I will therfore out of this very letter bring 8. ſundry arguments which ſhall euidently conuince that by the iudgement of the writer, going to the Church is a greeuous mortall ſinne.</p>

                     </gap>.</note> which S. Thomas doth thus declare. Whan the will (ſaieth he) is moued towardes any thing, which in it ſelfe is repugnant vnto that charity by which a man is ordained vnto his laſt end; that ſinne hath by the very obiect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that it is mortal. wherfore it is mortal of it owne nature, whether it be againſt the loue of God, as blaſphemy, periury and ſuch like: or againſt the loue of our neighbour as murder, adultery, &amp; ſuch others. Thus S. Thomas. So that this action of going to the Church, whether we conſider it as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13387:83"/>againſt faith, as being exteriour hereſy: or againſt charity to our neighbour as being ſchiſme, &amp; ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall: or againſt religion, as being a ſuperſtitious action: or againſt obedience as being forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſo many Eccleſiaſticall lawes: it is alwaies againſt neceſſary vertewes of Chriſtian life, and ſo mortall of it owne nature.</p>
               <p>Than do I thus argue. Whatſoeuer is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable in ſuch a kind of ſinne as is mortall of it owne nature, is alwaies a mortall ſinne: but ſo is this. ergo. &amp;c. The Maior is common amongſt all Diuines.<note place="margin">S. Tho ibid. &amp; ar. 6.</note> who affirme that mortall ſinnes ex ſuo genere, can neuer become veniall, except it be for the imperfection of the acte as not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, or the ſmallnes in quantity, as in the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a halfpeny. neither of which exceptions can here in this action take place. The Minor is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aboue. Secondly he ſaieth that this is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the practiſe of the Church, and the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and Fathers, vſe, and example in all ages: But fuch practiſe Doctours and Fathers eſteemed it alwaies a hainouſe matter, and ſeuerely reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it and puniſhed it, as all hiſtories do witneſſe: Therfore will the writer of the letter haue vs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it in like maner a hainouſe and greeuous offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly he referreth him ſelfe to ſundry treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note place="margin">See Teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. of Rhemes Mat. 10, 32 &amp; 2. e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly he alleageth the practiſe of England from the beginning of the miſſions of Prieſts: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But who is ſo impudent that he dare deny, that alwaies
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13387:84"/>thoſe W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haue liued in thoſe miſſions haue made it a mortall ſinne?</p>
               <p>Fifthly he ſaieth the Pope willed that ſuch as ſhould through frailty go to the Church ſhould be eaſely abſolued: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> than was it his iudgement and the Popes alſo that there was neceſſity to be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued which neceſſity is not in veniall ſinnes which are not neceſſary to be confeſſed. and are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by other meanes, than by abſolution: if ſo it pleaſe the Penitent.</p>
               <p>Sixthly he requireth ſorow, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> &amp; reaſonable hope that they will herafter ſtand more ſtrongly. which is a plaine argument of a mortall ſinne: for this is not required in a veniall ſinne.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly he calleth the abſoluing of them a receiuing againe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Than were they fallen out of the Church, and quite cutt of from Chriſt his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for this is the common vnderſtanding of this word, to receiue againe. And is there any doubte than of a mortall ſinne?</p>
               <p>Finally the intent of his letter was onely for to repreſſe the ſingularity of him W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was well knowen to teach the contrary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> who now by his going forth hath ſhewed how neare this point of doctrine in Gods iudgement is vnto flatte hereſy &amp; Atheiſme: and it was thought better to vſe this milde procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thè Eccleſiaſticall ſword. and yet certaine promiſe is made of that alſo if need require. Than was it not his intention to confirmed the others opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by cenſuring it as a veniall ſinne: neither is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſword to be drawen, but in caſe of mortall ſinne.</p>
               <p>God graunt therfore that theſe ſo graue and manitould autorities make thoſe which go to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13387:84"/>conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticles, yet at the leaſt to acknowledge their ſinne committed therin: &amp; not by defending ſo great an iniquity, both to increaſe their owne damnation, &amp; to cauſe the ruine of diuerſe others. If the lapſed will come to acknowledge their fault, to confeſſe their frailty, to abandon and forſake the ſame: the dore of Gods mercy is as open vnto them, as vnto all other ſinners. moſt lamentable is the eſtate of ſuch, who by obſtinae defence of ſinne, cannot ſeeke for redreſſe therof, but moſt deſperately runne into wilfull deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And leaſt this ſmall and ſimple labour inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely for the glory of God and for benefitte of the ſimpler ſorte, might chaunce to offend any per ſon at all: here do I proteſt that my penne is not directed againſt any particuler perſon, neither do I knowe any one particuler perſon whom theſe thinges may touch, and in my conſcience I ſuſpect none. and eſpecially of the Clergy I aſſure my ſelfe that at this preſent there is not one (beſides ſome which may liue openly in ſchiſme, for whom I can not anſwere, neither is it neceſſary) which diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this pointe from his Reuerend and worthy fellowes. Yet do I perfectly know that great hurte is donne euery where and that by Pamphlettes and perſwaſions of ſuch Lay perſons as amongſt the ſimple haue an vndeſerued conceite of vertew and learning.
